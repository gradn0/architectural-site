            It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when looking at its layout. 
            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here, content here', 
            making it look like readable English. Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text, 
            and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, 
            sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).

                <p>This house was designed on a very steeply sloping site with beautiful 180 degree sea views. The owner wanted a house in a Tuscan style but with a more contemporary feel.
                  The result was a 4 bedroom home split over 3 levels. The lowest level accommodating a 4 car garage with workshop, laundry and staff quarters.
                  The middle floor or pedestrian entry level consists of a spacious family lounge, reading area and large curved covered patio taking in the surrounding sea views. 
                  This level also includes the main bedroom, two other bedrooms and a family bathroom.
                  The top floor allows for a large open plan lounge, dining and kitchen area with scullery and pantry.
                  The lounge also opens up to the amazing views and includes a built in BBQ area.</p>

              <p>The owner of this terrace house wanted to revitalise his property and also open up the rear to communicate more directly with the garden.
                This transformation has been achieved by removing the old horizontal cladding and uPVC windows and replacing them with new through-colour render and black 
                aluminium windows. This revitalisation to the property has been achieved whilst still maintaining harmony with the neighbouring properties.                
                The interior was completely stripped out and transformed into a beautiful light-filled contemporary home.</p>

                due to an internal step making it feel like a separate room.
                The transformation created a well-insulated addition to the house that flowed seamlessly from the living room into the garden and pool area. 
                Crittal style windows and conservation roof lights were included, which upon completion, improved the value of the house dramatically.</p>
